# EventMobi Bulletin Board 

Project to be used for interview questions. Note that production level code quality is more important than finishing all of the suggested feature requests.

You have inherited a simple bulletin board project. The code is rough, and there are a number of outstanding feature requests and bugs. In addition, there may be additional problems not yet reported as issues. As the project owner it is your job to take the project to the next level. The direction of the project is your choice. You can choose whether or not to implement a given feature request and how to prioritize them, fix the bugs, update the style, or take the project in a new direction of your choosing.

Feature Requests
* John often submits a post before he's proofread it, and has complained several times that he can't fix the typoes after he submitted.
* Steve would like to know who created a post.
* Tamy thinks it would be cool if people viewing the bulletin board to be able to leave comments on posts.
* Kate wants to be able get old posts that are no longer needed off the frontpage so that it isn't so cluttered.
* Tim likes the bulletin board the way it is, but his chief concern is that no one ruins his reputation by creating posts under his name or editing the text of posts he created.

Bugs
* Users are reporting that the time created on new posts is not correct.
